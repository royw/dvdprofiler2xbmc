This script will attempt to match up media files from a set of directories
to the collection.xml file exported from DVD Profiler.  For matches, the
script will then create a {moviename}.nfo from the data in collections.xml
and also copy the front cover image to {moviename}.tbn.  Both files will
be placed in the same directory as the source media file.

Then on XBMC, set the source content to none to remove the meta data from
the library, then set the source content back to Movies to import the
media.  This time, the data in the .nfo files will be used instead of
scraping.

Notes:

1) currently you lose a few meta data fields such as Rating and Director
using this script instead of a scraper.

2) Currently only supports file based media containers, not directory
based.

3) Media filename convention is to take the media's title from DVD Profiler,
replace any punctuation with a space character, then replace any multiple
spaces with a single space.  Next remove any leading or trailing spaces.  
Optionally can append " - YYYY" where YYYY is the movie's release year.  
Naturally the extension is the media's container type.  Note, you should
not include in the title edition info like "Widescreen" or "Special Edition"
eventhough there are some mistakes in the DVD Profiler profiles that do
include these in the title.

Usage:
Edit the DIRECTORIES and locations below for your system.
Then run the script:
  ruby dvdprofiler2xbmc.rb
