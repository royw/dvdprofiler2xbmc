First check the version by running:

 $ bin/dvdprofiler2xbmc -v
 INFO dvdprofiler2xbmc: Dvdprofiler2xbmc 0.0.4
 INFO dvdprofiler2xbmc: saving: /home/royw/.dvdprofiler2xbmcrc

Notice that this generated a config file for you
(/home/royw/.dvdprofiler2xbmcrc) in your home directory.

Now edit the config file.  Be sure to change the following fields to match
your system:

  collection_filespec: /home/royw/DVD Profiler/Shared/Collection.xml
  images_dir: /home/royw/DVD Profiler/Shared/Images
  directories:
  - /media/dad-kubuntu/public/data/videos_iso
  - /media/dcerouter/public/data/videos_iso
  - /media/royw-gentoo/public/data/videos_iso
  - /media/royw-gentoo/public/data/movies
  genre_maps: !map:Mash
    Anime: Animation
    Science-Fiction: Science Fiction
    SciFi: Science Fiction
    Musical: Musicals

The "collection_filespec" points to the collection.xml file exported by
DVD Profiler.

The "images_dir" points to the directory containing the images (cover scans)
from DVD Profiler.

The "directories" are the top level directories of where your media is
stored.  Note, may be mount points or symbolic links.

The "genre_maps" is a list of genres to rename.  In the above example,
"Anime" will be renamed "Animation", "Science-Fiction" will be renamed
"Science Fiction", etc.

You may want to adjust these also:

  file_permissions: 436
  dir_permissions: 511

Note the permissions are the base 10 integer of the octal permission mask.
For example, 436 (base 10) is 664 (base 8) and 511 (base 10) is 777 (base 8).

Save the .dvdprofiler2xbmcrc file.

You may want to get the command line help by running:

  dvdprofiler2xbmc --help

To process your media, simply run:

  dvdprofiler2xbmc
